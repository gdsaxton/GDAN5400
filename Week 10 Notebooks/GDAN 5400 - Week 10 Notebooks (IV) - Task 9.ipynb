    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "We are doing some new things in the following code block, so I will walk you through the key parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define a dictionary of models (`models`)**  \n",
    "   - Several regression models are stored in a dictionary with their names as keys and model objects as values.  \n",
    "   - Models include **Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create an empty list (`results`)**  \n",
    "   - This list will store the performance of each model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loop through each model, train it, and evaluate it**  \n",
    "   - For each model:  \n",
    "     - It is trained using `X_train` and `y_train`.  \n",
    "     - It makes predictions on `X_val` (validation data).  \n",
    "     - The **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)** is calculated to measure model performance.  \n",
    "     - The model's name and its RMSLE score are added to the `results` list. \n",
    "   - Note that we are doing a basic `for` loop here. What is new is that we are looping not over a `list`, which you have seen before, but rather a `dictionary`. This means we use the `items()` method.\n",
    "     - The `.items()` method is used on dictionary objects such as our `models` dictionary, which is a dictionary where:\n",
    "       - `Keys` represent model names (e.g., 'Linear Regression', 'Random Forest').\n",
    "       - `Values` represent the actual model objects (e.g., LinearRegression(), RandomForestRegressor()).\n",
    "       - So, the line `for name, model in models.items():` returns key-value pairs from a dictionary.\n",
    "         - `for name, model` unpacks each pair:\n",
    "           - `name` gets the model's name (a string).\n",
    "           - `model` gets the actual model instance (e.g., `LinearRegression()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convert results into a Pandas DataFrame (`results_df`)**  \n",
    "   - The results are stored in a DataFrame and sorted in **ascending order by RMSLE**, so the best-performing model appears first.  \n",
    "   - For a refresher on *RMSLE* see the Week 9 materials.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Why Are We Doing the Code This Way?\n",
    "This approach allows us to **compare multiple models efficiently** and determine which one gives the best predictions for house prices. It helps us make an informed decision on **which model to use in the final analysis**.     \n",
