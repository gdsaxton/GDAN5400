    "\n",
    "Indeed, it appeared to be a bad storm, which could substantiate the large number of claims that she received for new roofs from hail and wind damage. Yet, she felt that something could be off.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Casey could not process the data from multiple companies, she knew that the National Insurance Crime Bureau might be able to help by aggregating data from multiple insurance companies across the area hit by the storm and evaluating the data to look for anomalies. Casey's request landed on your desk. As a new fraud specialist, you have been hired to investigate claims following storm damage to hopefully reduce the payouts made to false claimants. You also knew you had to act fast. You began by pulling the claims data for roofs. You also received a database that showed the actual path of this storm. Your task is to sort through the claims to see if there were any unusual claim patterns from this recent weather event.\n",
